# ðŸš€ Maze Adventure Game (React)

This is a simple, interactive "choose your own adventure" web game built with React.  
**Note:** This is not a full-featured or professional gameâ€”it's a project for learning JavaScript and React.

I created this project to practice JavaScript, React components, state, and basic game logic.  
You guide a character through a space-themed maze, make choices, see different outcomes, and collect a score as you play.  
The code is easy to read and modify, so you can extend it or use it as a template for your own learning.

## Features

- Story branches with multiple endings
- Simple animated character and images
- Score system based on your choices
- Modern, responsive design
- Space background for fun!
